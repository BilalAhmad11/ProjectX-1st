                    Why My College Experience Has Been My Most Valuable
                    By Julie Lain, YOUniversityTV Student Contributing Writer – As a kid, many people get asked
                    different variations of the same question: “What has been your best experience?” And even at that
                    age, there are many joyful moments to consider-birthday parties, trips to the local amusement park,
                    and bicycle-riding lessons. But often, it is not until your adult life that you go through many of
                    your most valuable events. Some, for instance, may find their time in the military to be of utmost
                    importance to them, while others sometimes find that their experience as a parent was the most
                    rewarding one they have had. Personally though, I consider my time in college as my most valuable
                    experience.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    First, my experience in college has given me a chance to sharpen my skills in my field of choice.
                    There have been, and there will continue to be, many opportunities to learn more ways of improving
                    my craft as a result of my time in school, which I am truly thankful for. For example, the Writing
                    Center at my school has taught me many writing tips and rules that I was unaware even existed, and
                    would still be unaware of had it not been a part of my experience. Because of this, I realized I
                    still had a lot to learn despite what I thought; but this allows me to improve my skills more as I
                    continue to attend school and also gives me more confidence in my area. And as a result, I know one
                    day this valuable experience will help me in my search for another one-a rewarding career.

                <p>
                    In addition to learning practical skills, being in college has also taught me a lot about social
                    sciences such as sociology and history. For instance, I have had the privilege of learning about
                    religions in unfamiliar parts of the world, such as Buddhism and Islam, that I had no knowledge of
                    beforehand. From this experience, I have learned many interesting things about the cultures in which
                    these religions are typically followed. Learning about many different religious ideas and practices
                    in other areas of the world, like meditation, reincarnation, and the worshipping of multiple
                    deities, has been valuable to me because it has cleared up some misconceptions I had, thus allowing
                    me to be less ignorant on the topic. It has also given me a better understanding of others’ beliefs
                    and traditions, no matter what region of the world they originated. This has made my time in college
                    much more enriching and worthwhile.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    My experience in college, particularly the English program, has also allowed me to gain more
                    knowledge about a variety of literary authors and types of literature. Had I not decided to attend
                    Carthage, I would never have known about classic writers like Katherine Anne Porter, Kate Chopin and
                    the many different plays from William Shakespeare. I have also learned more about what fables, short
                    stories and poems are and how to tell between them. Also, reading those classic pieces has given me
                    insight into what it was like to live in the author’s time era and what the oppressed female writers
                    had to go through. Not only is this knowledge interesting to learn, but recognizing the differences
                    between various methods of story-writing will also help me to be more versatile as a writer, thus
                    improving my future career.
